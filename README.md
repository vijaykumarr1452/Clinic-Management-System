# Clinic-Management-System (__https://www.myecho.co.in/index.php__)

### **Overview**
The Clinic Management System (CMS) is a full-stack web application designed to streamline clinic operations. It includes:
- A **frontend** built with Angular for managing user interactions and displaying data.
- A **backend** built with Node.js for handling API requests, authentication, and database operations.

This system is modular and scalable, making it suitable for small to medium-sized clinics.

## **Analysis of `dcm_script.py`**

This script is designed to analyze and process DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files, typically used in medical imaging. It uses libraries like `pydicom` (for reading DICOM files), `opencv-python` (for image/video processing), and `Pillow` (potentially for image handling). Below is a breakdown of its key functionalities:

---

#### **A. DICOM File Handling**
- **Reading DICOM Files**:  
  The script uses `pydicom.dcmread()` to read DICOM files and convert them into JSON-like structures for analysis and processing.

- **Branching Logic**:
  - `readDicom(file_path)` determines the type of data in the file and delegates processing to:
    - `readDataDicom(file_path)`: For DICOM data files with findings.
    - `readFileDicom(file_path)`: For DICOM files containing pixel data (images/videos).

---

#### **B. Image and Video Creation**
- **createImage(img, file_path)**:
  - Converts an image from LAB color space to BGR using OpenCV.
  - Saves the image in JPEG format and outputs metadata as JSON.

- **createVideo(imgs, height, width, file_path)**:
  - Compiles a sequence of images into a video (MP4 format) using OpenCV.
  - Outputs metadata as JSON.

---

#### **C. Metadata Extraction**
The script extracts structured data (like patient details and findings) from the DICOM file:

- **Patient Data**:
  - `getPatientData(output, patient)` extracts metadata such as:
    - Patient name, sex, date of birth, ID, size, weight.
    - Manufacturer details, report details, and institution name.

- **Findings Data**:
  - `getFindings(findings_array)` processes medical findings, such as:
    - Finding site details (e.g., anatomical location).
    - Image modes, identifiers, and associated data.

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `getItemData`, `getIdentifier`, `getValue`, and `getListData` process nested DICOM metadata for better organization.

---


### **3. Dependencies**
- **pydicom**: For DICOM file handling.
- **opencv-python**: For image and video processing.
- **json**: To format and output metadata.
- **datetime**: For date formatting.
- **pathlib**: For path manipulations.

---

### **4. Strengths**
- Comprehensive handling of both pixel data (images/videos) and metadata (patient and findings).
- Modular design with helper functions for specific tasks.
- JSON output for interoperability with other systems.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Angular CLI (v9.1.9 or later)
- [Database software]

### **2. Installation**

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
